Investors face fragmented workflows in sourcing, analyzing, and financing investment properties. This project aims to create a seamless, AI-powered platform where investors can search properties, analyze deals, and access loan products directly, reducing reliance on realtors and loan officers.

Goals:
All-in-one property sourcing, analysis, and financing experience.
AI guidance via chatbot support for both novice and experienced investors.
Automated quote and loan application flows with document upload.
Actionable data: Real-time analytics, tax info, and projected returns.
Scalable marketing/data capture for user retention and future outreach.
